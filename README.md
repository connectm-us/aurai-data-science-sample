# aurai-data-science-sample

This repository contains sample data (docs, tools, etc. coming soon) produced by the Aurai platform. The goal of this repository is to provide a starting point for data scientists to build [Data Analyzers](http://developer.aurai.io/docs/#data-analysis-provider) for the Aurai platform.

### sample-data/home-rooms.csv.zip
This [file](sample-data/home-rooms.csv.zip) contains ~3 months of average temperature, pressure, and humidity data for individual rooms in ~360 homes at an hourly resolution. See [http://developer.aurai.io/docs/#raw-data-format](http://developer.aurai.io/docs/#raw-data-format) for information on the format of the data and how to interpret it.
